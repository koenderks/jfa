\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing the input data.}

\item{protected}{a character specifying the column name in \code{data}
containing the protected classes (i.e., the sensitive attribute).}

\item{target}{a character specifying the column name in \code{data}
containing the true labels of the target (i.e., to be predicted) variable.}

\item{predictions}{a character specifying the column name in \code{data}
containing the predicted labels of the target variable.}

\item{privileged}{a character specifying the factor level of the column
\code{protected} to be used as the privileged group. If \code{NULL} (the
default), the first factor level of the \code{protected} column is used.}

the column \code{target} to be used as the positive class. If \code{NULL}
(the default), the first factor level of the \code{target} column is used.}

\item{metric}{a character indicating the fairness metrics to compute.
See the Details section below for more information.}

\item{alternative}{a character indicating the alternative hypothesis and
the type of confidence / credible interval used in the individual
comparisons to the privileged group. Possible options are  \code{two.sided}
(default), \code{less}, or \code{greater}. The alternative hypothesis
relating to the overall equality is always two sided.}

\item{conf.level}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the
confidence level (i.e., 1 - audit risk / detection risk).}

\item{prior}{a logical specifying whether to use a prior distribution,
or a numeric value equal to or larger than 1 specifying the prior
concentration parameter. If this argument is specified as \code{FALSE}
(default), classical estimation is performed and if it is \code{TRUE},
Bayesian estimation using a default prior with concentration parameter 1 is
performed.}

\description{
This function aims to assess fairness in algorithmic
decision-making systems by computing and testing the equality of one of
several model-agnostic fairness metrics between protected classes. The
metrics are computed based on a set of true labels and the predictions of an
algorithm. The ratio of these metrics between any unprivileged protected
class and the privileged protected class is called parity. This measure can
quantify potential fairness or discrimination in the algorithms predictions.
Available parity metrics include predictive rate parity, proportional parity,
accuracy parity, false negative rate parity, false positive rate parity, true
positive rate parity, negative predicted value parity, specificity parity,
and demographic parity. The function returns an object of class
\code{jfaFairness} that can be used with associated \code{summary()} and
\code{plot()} methods.
}
\details{
The following model-agnostic fairness metrics are computed based on
  the confusion matrix for each protected class, using the true positives
  (TP), false positives (FP), true negative (TN) and false negatives (FN).
  See Pessach & Shmueli (2022) for a more detailed explanation of the
  individual metrics. The equality of metrics across groups is done according
  to the methodology described in Fisher (1970) and Jamil et al. (2017).

  \itemize{
    \item{Predictive rate parity (\code{prp}): calculated as TP / (TP +
      FP), its ratio quantifies whether the predictive rate is equal across
      protected classes.}
    \item{Proportional parity (\code{pp}): calculated as (TP + FP) / (TP +
      FP + TN + FN), its ratio quantifies whether the positive prediction
      rate is equal across protected classes.}
    \item{Accuracy parity (\code{ap}): calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + FP +
      TN + FN), quantifies whether the accuracy is the same across groups.}
    \item{False negative rate parity (\code{fnrp}): }{calculated as FN / (FP
      + FN), quantifies whether the false negative rate is the same across
      groups.}
    \item{False positive rate parity (\code{fprp}): calculated as FP / (TN
      + FP), quantifies whether the false positive rate is the same across
      groups.}
    \item{True positive rate parity (\code{tprp}): calculated as TP / (TP +
      FN), quantifies whether the true positive rate is the same across
      groups.}
    \item{Negative predicted value parity (\code{npvp}): calculated as TN /
      (TN + FN), quantifies whether the negative predicted value is equal
      across groups.}
    \item{Specificity parity (\code{sp}): calculated as TN / (TN + FP),
      quantifies whether the true positive rate is the same across groups.}
    \item{Demographic parity (\code{dp}): calculated as TP + FP, quantifies
      whether the positive predictions are equal across groups.}

  Note that, in an audit context, not all fairness measures are equally
  appropriate in all situations. The fairness tree below aids in choosing
  which fairness measure is appropriate for the situation at hand (Büyük,
  2023).
