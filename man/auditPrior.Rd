\usage{
auditPrior(confidence = 0.95, likelihood = "binomial", method = "none",

\arguments{
\item{confidence}{the confidence level desired from the confidence bound (on a scale from 0 to 1). Defaults to 0.95, or 95\% confidence.}

\item{likelihood}{can be one of \code{binomial}, \code{poisson}, or \code{hypergeometric}. See the Details section for more information.}

\item{method}{the method by which the prior distribution is constructed. Defaults to the \code{arm} method, which uses the audit risk model (Derks et al., 2019). Can be one of \code{none}, \code{median}, \code{hypotheses}, \code{arm}, \code{sample} or \code{factor}. See the Details section for more information.}

\item{expectedError}{a fraction representing the percentage of expected mistakes in the sample relative to the total size, or a number (>= 1) that represents the number of expected mistakes.}

\item{N}{the population size (only required when \code{likelihood = 'hypergeometric'}).}

\item{materiality}{a value between 0 and 1 representing the materiality of the audit as a fraction of the total size or value. Can be \code{NULL} for some methods.}

\item{ir}{the inherent risk probability from the audit risk model. Defaults to 1 for 100\% risk.}

\item{cr}{the inherent risk probability from the audit risk model. Defaults to 1 for 100\% risk.}

\item{pHmin}{When using \code{method = 'hypotheses'}, the prior probability of the hypothesis \eqn{\theta <} materiality.}

\item{pHplus}{When using \code{method = 'hypotheses'}, the prior probability of the hypothesis \eqn{\theta >} materiality.}

\item{factor}{When using \code{method = 'factor'}, the value of the weighting factor for the results of the previous sample.}

\item{sampleN}{When using method \code{sample} or \code{factor}, the number of transactions that were inspected in the previous sample.}

\item{sampleK}{When using method \code{sample} or \code{factor}, the total taint in the previous sample.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{jfaPrior} containing:

\item{confidence}{the method by which the prior distribution is constructed.}
\item{likelihood}{the likelihood by which the prior distribution is updated.}
\item{method}{the method by which the prior distribution is constructed.}
\item{expectedError}{the expected error input.}
\item{N}{if specified as input, the population size.}
\item{materiality}{if specified, the materiality that was used to construct the prior distribution.}
\item{description}{a description of the prior distribution, including parameters and the implicit sample.}
\item{statistics}{a list of statistics of the prior distribution, including the mean, mode, median, and upper bound.}
\item{specifics}{a list of optional specifications of the prior distribution, these depend on the method used.}
\item{hypotheses}{if a materiality is specified, a list of statistics about the hypotheses including prior probabilities and odds.}
}
\description{
This function creates a prior distribution for Bayesian audit sampling according to several methods discussed in Derks et al. (2020). The returned object is of class \code{jfaPrior} and can be used with associated \code{print()} and \code{plot()} methods. \code{jfaPrior} objects can be used as input for the \code{prior} argument in other functions.

\details{
This section elaborates on the available methods for constructing a prior distribution.

This section elaborates on the available likelihoods and corresponding prior distributions for the \code{likelihood} argument.

\itemize{
 \item{\code{poisson}:          The Poisson likelihood is used as a likelihood for monetary unit sampling (MUS). Its likelihood function is defined as: \deqn{p(x) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}} The conjugate \emph{gamma(\eqn{\alpha, \beta})} prior has probability density function: \deqn{f(x; \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^\alpha x^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\beta x}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}}}
 \item{\code{binomial}:         The binomial likelihood is used as a likelihood for record sampling \emph{with} replacement. Its likelihood function is defined as: \deqn{p(x) = {n \choose k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}} The conjugate \emph{beta(\eqn{\alpha, \beta})} prior has probability density function: \deqn{f(x; \alpha, \beta) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1} (1 - x)^{\beta - 1}}}
 \item{\code{hypergeometric}:   The hypergeometric likelihood is used as a likelihood for record sampling \emph{without} replacement. Its likelihood function is defined as: \deqn{p(x = k) = \frac{{K \choose k} {N - K \choose n - k}}{{N \choose n}}} The conjugate \emph{beta-binomial(\eqn{\alpha, \beta})} prior (Dyer and Pierce, 1993) has probability density function: \deqn{f(k | n, \alpha, \beta) = {n \choose k} \frac{B(k + \alpha, n - k + \beta)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}} }
}

\itemize{
 \item{\code{none}:              This method constructs a prior distribution according to the principle of minimum information.}
 \item{\code{median}:            This method constructs a prior distribution so that the prior probabilities of tolerable and intolerable misstatement are equal.}
 \item{\code{hypotheses}:        This method constructs a prior distribution with specified prior probabilities for the hypotheses of tolerable and intolerable misstatement. Requires specification of the \code{pHmin} and \code{pHplus} arguments.}
 \item{\code{arm}:               This method constructs a prior distribution according to the assessed risks in the audit risk model. Requires specification of the \code{ir} and \code{cr} arguments.}
 \item{\code{sample}:            This method constructs a prior distribution on the basis of an earlier sample. Requires specification of the \code{sampleN} and \code{sampleK} arguments.}
 \item{\code{factor}:            This method constructs a prior distribution on the basis of last year's results and a weighting factor. Requires specification of the \code{factor}, \code{sampleN} and \code{sampleK} arguments.}
