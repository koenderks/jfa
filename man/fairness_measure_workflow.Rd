)
}
\arguments{
\item{q1}{a character indicating the answer to the first question of the decision-making workflow.
If \code{NULL} (the default) the user is presented with the first question of the decision-making
workflow and can respond interactively by selecting the numerical value corresponding to their
desired answer. Possible options are \code{NULL} (default), \code{1} (to indicate 'Yes'), or
\code{2} (to indicate 'No').}

\item{q2}{a character indicating the answer to the second question of the decision-making workflow.
If \code{NULL} (the default) the user is presented with the second question of the decision-making
workflow and can respond interactively by selecting the numerical value corresponding to their
desired answer. Possible options are \code{NULL} (default), \code{1} (to indicate 'Correct Classification'),
\code{2} (to indicate 'Incorrect Classification'), or \code{3} (to indicate 'Correct and
Incorrect Classification').}

\item{q3}{a character indicating the answer to the third question of the decision-making workflow.
If \code{NULL} (the default) the user is presented with the third question of the decision-making
workflow and can respond interactively by selecting the numerical value corresponding to their
desired answer. Possible options are \code{NULL} (default), \code{1} (to indicate 'Everythig not positive'),
or \code{2} (to indicate 'Well-defined').}

\item{q4}{a character indicating the answer to the fourth question of the decision-making workflow.
If \code{NULL} (the default) the user is presented with the fourth question of the decision-making
workflow and can respond interactively by selecting the numerical value corresponding to their
desired answer. Possible options are \code{NULL} (default), \code{1} (to indicate 'False Positive'),
\code{2} (to indicate 'False Negative'), or \code{3} (to indicate 'No preference').}

\value{
An object of class \code{jfaFairness} containing:

\item{measure}{The abbreviation of the selected fairness measure. Possible options are \code{di},

             \code{Negative Predictive Rate Parity}, \code{Accuracy Parity}, \code{False Positive Rate Parity},

\description{
This function aims to provide a fairness measure tailored
to a specific context and dataset by answering the questions in the developed
decision-making workflow. The questions within the decision-making workflow are based
on observable data characteristics, the properties of fairness measures and the
information required for their calculation. However, these questions are posed to the user
in an easily understandable manner, requiring no statistical background or in-depth knowledge of the fairness measures.
Obtainable fairness measures include Disparate Impact, Equalized Odds, Predictive Rate Parity,
Equal Opportunity, Specificity Parity, Negative Predictive Rate Parity, Accuracy Parity,
False Positive Rate Parity and False Negative Rate Parity. The function returns an object
of class \code{jfaFairnessWorkflow} that can be used with associated \code{print()} and \code{plot()} methods.

\details{
Several fairness measures can be used to assess the fairness of AI-predicted classifications. These include:

  \itemize{
    \item{Disparate Impact. See Friedler et al. (2019), Feldman et al. (2015),
         Castelnovo et al. (2022) and and Büyük, S. (2023) for a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{Equalized Odds. See Hardt et al. (2016), Verma et al. (2018) and Büyük, S. (2023)
           for a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{False Positive Rate Parity. See Castelnovo et al. (2022) (under the name Predictive Equality),
           Verma et al. (2018) and Büyük, S. (2023) for a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{False Negative Rate Parity. See Castelnovo et al. (2022) (under the name Equality of Opportunity),
           Verma et al. (2018) and Büyük, S. (2023) for a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{Predictive Rate Parity. See Castelnovo et al. (2022) (under the name Predictive Parity) and Büyük, S. (2023) for
           a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{Equal Opportunity. See Hardt et al. (2016), Friedler et al. (2019), Verma et al. (2018) and Büyük, S. (2023) for
           a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{Specificity Parity. See Friedler et al. (2019), Verma et al. (2018) and Büyük, S. (2023) for
           a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{Negative Predictive Rate Parity. See Verma et al. (2018) and Büyük, S. (2023) for a more detailed explanation of this measure.}
    \item{Accuracy Parity. See Friedler et al. (2019) and Büyük, S. (2023) for a more detailed explanation of this measure.}

The fairness decision-making workflow below aids in choosing
  which fairness measure is appropriate for the situation at hand. It is important to note that
  there are three specific input parameter combinations ((q1="1", q2="2", q3="1", q4="3"),
  (q1="1", q2="2", q3="2", q4="3") and (q1="1", q2="1", q3="1", q4="3")) for which a fairness measure is currently
  unavailable as outcome that meet the required input criteria.
