# jfa 0.7.3

**New features**

- @lottemensink added `plot(x, type = "sequential")` to the `evaluation()` function when used with `prior`, `materiality` and `data`. The plot shows Bayes factors as a function of the sample size.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug in the `evaluation()` function using `method = "hypergeometric"` where the user could provide broken taints. These taints are now rounded to the nearest integer value.

# jfa 0.7.2

**Minor changes**

- In the `auditPrior()` function, `method = "factor"` has been replaced with `method = "power"` to be consistent with existing terminology.
- `selection()` now always performs sampling with replacement when using `items = "values"` and `method = "random"` (Thanks to @lottemensink for the suggestion). This should not lead to substantial differences in typical audit populations.

# jfa 0.7.1

**New features**

- Added the option to calculate a frequentist multi-stage sampling plan with the `planning()` function. This can be done by providing a vector of integers to the `expected` argument that specifies the intended sampling plan. For instance, `expected = c(1, 0)` gives the sample size for a two-stage sampling plan in which the auditor is allowed to extend the initial sample after finding one misstatement and is allowed to approve the population if the initial sample contains no misstatements.
- Added inflated methods to evaluate taintings in the evaluation function via `method = "inflated.poisson"` and `method = "hurdle.beta"`. Since these methods rely on mcmc sampling, they can take any form of prior. They can also be fitted using maximum likelihood estimation with `prior = FALSE`.

**Minor changes**

- For all plotting functions, `type = "estimates"` is now the default option.

**Major changes**

- Removed the `report()` function as it did not align with the rest of the functionality in the package.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug in `selection()` where the numeric data in the sample was returned as character if the original data was entered as character only (i.e., `selection(data.frame(x = c("hello", "bye", "hi")), size = 2)`).
- `N.units` is now only taken from the prior if the user does not provide it manually to the `planning()` and `evaluation()` functions.

# jfa 0.7.0

**New features**

- Added a new function `model_fairness()` to compute fairness metrics for algorithm auditing on the basis of predictions of an algorithm.

**Minor changes**

- In the `evaluation()` function, the typical stringer bound has been changed from `method = "stringer"` to `method = "stringer.binomial"`. Furthermore, additional methods `stringer.poisson` and `stringer.hypergeometric` are added that apply the stringer bound using the Poisson and hypergeometric distributions, respectively. The `stringer` method will remain for now but redirect to `stringer.binomial`.
- Compatibility with `rstantools 2.3.1`.

# jfa 0.6.7

**New features**

- `digit_test()` function now returns element `estimates` containing observed proportions and their corresponding confidence intervals. The plot output also shows these intervals around the estimates.

# jfa 0.6.6

**Bug fixes**

- Changed the links to the images in the vignettes from absolute links to GitHub to relative links as to avoid problems with GitHub servers being unavailable in the future.

# jfa 0.6.5

**New features**

- Additional possibilities to create, plan and evaluate using nonparametric prior distributions.
- Added functionality for stratified evaluation in the `evaluation()` function.
- Integrated the auditing functionality of the `digitTests` package via the `digit_test()` and `repeated_test()` functions.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug where the proportion of value in `summary(selection)` was displayed incorrectly.

**Minor changes**

- Improved the error handling and error messages.

# jfa 0.6.4

**Minor changes**

- Resolved CRAN note `Warning: <img> attribute "align" not allowed for HTML5`.
- Improve compatibility with `R 4.2.0`.

# jfa 0.6.3

**Minor changes**

- The value for `x` in `evaluation()` and `expected` in `planning()` is now automatically ceiled (while throwing a warning) for `method = "hypergeometric"`.
- Improved overall documentation.

# jfa 0.6.2

**Major changes**

- Removed the output and functions related to the class `jfaPredictive`. The probabilities for the prior and posterior predictive distributions can be obtained by calling the `predict()` function.

**Minor changes**

- The value for `N.units` in `auditPrior()`, `planning()`, and `evaluation()` is now automatically ceiled for `likelihood`/`method` = `'hypergeometric'`.
- Implemented a warning message when the `likelihood` in the `prior` does not match with the `likelihood`/`method` inputs for `planning()` and `evaluation()`. The likelihood from the prior is leading in these cases and will overrule the other options.

# jfa 0.6.1

**New features**

- Added argument `randomize` to the `selection()` function, which allows the user to randomly shuffle the items in the population before selection. Note that specifying `randomize = TRUE` overrules `order`.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug where the maximum sample size was not reached (i.e., `planning` stopped at `max` - 1).

**Major changes**

- The `order` argument in `selection()` no longer accepts a logical, but instead takes the column name of the ranking variable in the `data`.

**Minor changes**

- Adjusted an error in the text of the selection vignette.
- Rewritten most of the vignettes.

# jfa 0.6.0

**New features**

- Added argument `alternative` with possible options `less` (default), `two.sided`, and `greater` to the `evaluation()` function that allows control over the type of hypothesis test to perform and the type of confidence / credible interval to calculate.
- Added `predict.jfaPrior()` and `predict.jfaPosterior()` that produce predictions for the data under the prior or posterior distribution.
- Added `method = 'param'` to function `auditPrior()` which takes as input the raw `alpha` and `beta` parameters of the prior distribution.
- Added `method = 'strict'` to function `auditPrior()` which constructs an (improper) prior distribution that yields the same results (with respect to sample sizes and upper limits) as classical procedures.
- Added the modified seed sampling algorithm (`method = 'sieve')` to `selection()`.
- Added a new vignette that describes the sampling methodology implemented in `jfa`.
- objects from `auditPrior()`, `planning()`, and `evaluation()` now contain information about the posterior predictive distribution when `N.units` is specified.

**Major changes**

- From `jfa` 0.5.7 to `jfa` 0.6.0 there has been a major overhaul in the names of function arguments. This is done so that the calls integrate better with general R syntax and the package gets more user-friendly. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. The following names have been changed:
  - `median` -> `impartial` (in `auditPrior()`)
  - `sampleK` -> `x` (in `auditPrior()`)
  - `sampleN` -> `n` (in `auditPrior()`)
  - `N` -> `N.units` (in `auditPrior()`)
  - `maxSize` -> `max` (in `planning()`)
  - `increase` -> `by` (in `planning()`)
  - `withReplacement`-> `replace` (in `selection()`)
  - `ordered` -> `order` (in `selection()`)
  - `ascending` -> `decreasing` (in `selection()`)
  - `intervalStartingPoint` -> `start` (in `selection()`)
  - `algorithm` -> `method` (in `selection()`)
  - `expectedErrors` -> `expected` (in `auditPrior()` and `planning()`)
  - `confidence` -> `conf.level` (in `auditPrior()`, `planning()`, and `evaluation()`)
  - `pHmin` -> `p.hmin` (in `auditPrior()`)
  - `minPrecision` -> `min.precision` (in `auditPrior()`, `planning()`, and `evaluation()`)
  - `population` -> `data` (in `selection()`)
  - `kSumstats` -> `x` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `nSumstats` -> `n` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `sample` -> `data` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `bookValues` -> `values` (in `selection()` and `evaluation()`)
  - `auditValues` -> `values.audit` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `counts` -> `times` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `popBookValues` -> `N.units` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `rohrbachDelta` -> `r.delta` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `momentPopType` -> `m.type` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `csA` -> `cs.a` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `csB` -> `cs.b` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `csMu` -> `cs.mu` (in `evaluation()`)
  - `records` -> `items` (in `selection()`)
  - `mus` -> `values` (in `selection()`)
  - `hypotheses` -> `hyp` (in `auditPrior()`)
- `poisson` is now the default likelihood / method for all functions since it is the most conservative.
- `method = 'interval'` is now the default selection method.
- The default prior distributions used when `method = 'default'` or `prior = TRUE` are now set to the `gamma(1, 1)`, `beta(1,1)`, and `beta-binomial(1, 1)` priors.
- The `times` (former `counts`) argument in `evaluation()` must now be indicated as a column name in the `data` instead of a vector.
- `nPrior` and `kPrior` have been removed from the `planning()` and `evaluation()` functions. All prior distributions must now be specified using `prior = TRUE` (noninformative priors) or using a call to `auditPrior()`.
- Removed the `auditBF()` function since its value is available through `evaluation(materiality = x, prior = auditPrior(method = 'impartial', materiality = x))`

**Minor changes**

- It is now allowed for `x` and `n` to have the same value in `evaluation()`.
- The parameters for an impartial beta-binomial prior are now calculated more efficiently in the case of zero expected errors.

# jfa 0.5.7

**Minor changes**

- The logo is now displayed in the `?jfa-package` help file.
- The cheat sheet link has changed in the README file.

# jfa 0.5.6

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug in the `print.jfaEvaluation()` call if there was no performance materiality specified and `prior = TRUE`.

# jfa 0.5.5

**New features**

- The `print()` functions now return a more concise description of the relevant output.
- Added `summary()` functions for all returned objects that take over the former (elaborate) output of the `print()` functions.
- Implemented a new function `auditBF()` which computes Bayes factors from summary statistics of an audit sample.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug in `evaluation()` in which the likelihood stored in the prior was not properly passed to the function.
- Fixed an error in the calculation of the posterior mode of the beta distribution.

**Minor changes**

- Restored the default value (0.95) for the 'confidence' argument in all applicable functions.

# jfa 0.5.4

**New features**

- Objects with class `jfaPosterior` as returned by `evaluation()$posterior` and `planning()$expectedPosterior` can now be used as input for the `prior` argument in the `planning()` and `evaluation()` functions.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug in `method = 'bram'` in the `auditPrior()` function where the prior parameters would go off to infinity when `expectedError = 0`.

**Major changes**

- Now calculates the upper bound for the population errors according to the hypergeometric distribution via an inverted hypothesis test. As a result of this method, the `planning()` function does not require a value for the `materiality` anymore when planning with the `hypergeometric` likelihood.

**Minor changes**

- Added a benchmark for the `MUS` package to the unit tests.
- Improved plots with better titles and axes labels.

# jfa 0.5.3

**New features**

- Made `expectedErrors > 0` available for `method = 'hypotheses'` in the `auditPrior()` function.
- Made `method = 'hypotheses'` and `method = 'impartial'` in the `auditPrior()` function available for `likelihood = 'hypergeometric'`.
- Added `bram` as a method for the `auditPrior()` function. `method = 'bram'` computes a prior distribution with a given mode (`expectedError`) and upper bound (`ub`).

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an error in the mode of the gamma posterior distribution from the `evaluation()` function in which `+1` was added to the beta parameter, resulting in slightly lower modes than the correct ones.
- Made a correction to the calculation of the beta-binomial prior and posterior so that the posterior parameter `N` has the correct value of `N = N - n` (current) instead of `N - n + k` (before).

**Major changes**

- Removed the default value `confidence = 0.95` in all applicable functions. `confidence` currently has no default value so that the user is required to give an input.
- Changed the default `likelihood = 'poisson'` in the `planning()` function to `likelihood = 'binomial'` to be consistent across all functions.
- Changed the order of most function arguments so that `materiality` and `minPrecision` are among the first ones to be shown.

**Minor changes**

- Updated the documentation for all functions with more simple examples.

# jfa 0.5.2

**New features**

- Update the poisson evaluation calculation so that it allows for fractional errors.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an error in the hypergeometric upper bound calculation that was accidentally based on the `phyper()` function instead of the `qhyper()` function, which resulted in lower bounds than usual.

**Minor changes**

- Add statistical tables with output (sample sizes, upper limits, Bayes factors) to the GitHub repository in pdf format.
- Changed the computation method of the sample sizes for hypergeometric and beta-binomial distributions so that they are faster.

# jfa 0.5.1

**Bug fixes**

- Reduced the size of the tarball by adding files to the .Rbuildignore
- Fixed a bug in `selection()` where if `population` is sorted or modified, `bv` still retained the old ordering and data. The resulting sample was overweighted towards small values and/or still contained negative values (Thanks to @alvanson).

# jfa 0.5.0

**New features**

- Add a function `report()` that automatically generates an audit report.

**Major changes**

- Removed the `sampling()` function, which is now replaced entirely with the `selection()` function.
- Changed the output of the `evaluation()` function when an estimator is used.

# jfa 0.4.0

**New features**

- Added `digits` argument in the internal `jfa:::print.jfaPrior()`, `jfa:::print.jfaPlanning()`, `jfa:::print.jfaSelection()`, and `jfa:::print.jfaEvaluation()` functions to control rounding in printing.
- Added `description`, `statistics`, `specifics` and `hypotheses` to the output of the `auditPrior()` function.
- Added class `jfaPosterior` with `print()` and `plot()` methods.
- Added `expectedPosterior` of class `jfaPosterior` to the output of the `planning()` function, includes `description`, `statistics` and `hypotheses`.
- Added `posterior` of class `jfaPosterior` to the output of the `evaluation()` function, includes `description`, `statistics` and `hypotheses`.

**Bug fixes**

- Implemented improved calculation of prior parameters in the `auditPrior()` function for `method = impartial` when `expectedErrors > 0`.

**Major changes**

- Add a warning message to the `sampling()` function that it will be deprecated from 0.5.0 onward. You can use `selection()` instead, since `sampling()` causes namespace issues with other packages.

**Minor changes**

- Changed the class `jfaSampling` to `jfaSelection`. This should not have any consequences. 

# jfa 0.3.1

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug in the `planning()` function that did not allow the user to plan for a monetary sample when their population size was too low.
- Fixed a bug in the `planning()` function that did not allow the user to select a non-integer number of expected errors when there was a prior involved.

**Minor changes**

- Added unit tests that regularly verify results of the `planning()` and `evaluation()` functions against benchmarks.

# jfa 0.3.0

**New features**

- Implemented the argument `counts` in the `evaluation()` function that quantifies how many times each observation should be evaluated due to being selected multiple times in the selection stage.

# jfa 0.2.0

**New features**

- Implemented prior construction methods `default`, `impartial`, `hypotheses`, `sample`, and `factor` in the `auditPrior()` function. In addition to the already supported `arm` method, these methods allow the auditor to incorporate more sources of audit information into the prior distribution.  
- Implemented `minPrecision` argument in the `planning()` function that allows auditors to calculate a sample size so that the difference between the posterior upper confidence bound and the most likely error is lower than the set minimum precision. Also implemented in the `evaluation()` function as a requirement to approve the population.
- Return the value `mle` from the `evaluation()` function, which quantifies the most likely error. Also return the value of the `precision` from this function.
- Implemented `increase` argument in the `planning()` function that allows the user to increase the sample size with a set amount each step of the iterations.

**Minor changes**

- Implemented more efficient versions of the monetary unit sampling algorithms.
- Changed the x-axis labels in the default plot to theta instead of misstatement.

# jfa 0.1.0

**New features**

- First version of the `jfa` package. The package provides four functions: `auditPrior()`, `planning()`, `sampling()`, and `evaluation()`.
