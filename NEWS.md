# jfa 0.5.3

- Changed the order of most function arguments so that `materiality` and `minPrecision` are among the first ones.
- Removed the default value of `confidence = 0.95` in all applicable functions, it currently has no default so that the user is required to give an input.
- Made an correction to the calculation of the beta-binomial prior and posterior so that the posterior parameter `N` has the correct value of `N = N - n` (current) instead of `N - n + k` (before).
- Updated the documentation for the functions with simpler examples.
- Fixed an error in the mode of the gamma posterior distribution from the `evaluation()` function in which `+1` was added to the beta parameter, resulting in slighly lower modes than the correct ones.

# jfa 0.5.2

- Update the poisson evaluation calculation so that it allows for fractional errors.
- Add statistical tables with output (sample sizes, upper limits, Bayes factors) to the GitHub repository in pdf format.
- Changed the computation method of the sample sizes for hypergeometric and beta-binomial distributions so that they are faster.
- Fixed an error in the hypergeometric upper bound calculation that was accidentally based on the `phyper()` function instead of the `qhyper()` function, which resulted in lower bounds than usual.

# jfa 0.5.1

- Reduced the size of the tarball by adding files to the .Rbuildignore
- Fixed a bug in `selection()` where if `population` is sorted or modified, `bv` still retained the old ordering and data. The resulting sample was overweighted towards small values and/or still contained negative values (Thanks to @alvanson).

# jfa 0.5.0

- Add a function `report()` that automatically generates an audit report.
- Removed the `sampling()` function, which is now replaced entirely with the `selection()` function.
- Changed the output of the `evaluation()` function when an estimator is used.

# jfa 0.4.0

- Implemented improved calculation of prior parameters in the `auditPrior()` function for `method = median` when `expectedErrors > 0`.
- Added `digits` argument in the internal `jfa:::print.jfaPrior()`, `jfa:::print.jfaPlanning()`, `jfa:::print.jfaSelection()`, and `jfa:::print.jfaEvaluation()` functions to control rounding in printing.
- Added `description`, `statistics`, `specifics` and `hypotheses` to the output of the `auditPrior()` function.
- Added class `jfaPosterior` with `print()` and `plot()` methods.
- Added `expectedPosterior` of class `jfaPosterior` to the output of the `planning()` function, includes `description`, `statistics` and `hypotheses`.
- Added `posterior` of class `jfaPosterior` to the output of the `evaluation()` function, includes `description`, `statistics` and `hypotheses`.
- Add a warning message to the `sampling()` function that it will be deprecated from 0.5.0 onward. You can use `selection()` instead, since `sampling()` causes namespace issues with other packages.
- Changed the class `jfaSampling` to `jfaSelection`. This should not have any consequences. 

# jfa 0.3.1

- Added unit tests that regularly verify results of the `planning()` and `evaluation()` functions against benchmarks.
- Fixed two bugs in the `planning()` function. The first bug did not allow the user to plan for a monetary sample when their population size was too low. The second bug did not allow the user to select a non-integer number of expected errors when there was a prior involved.

# jfa 0.3.0

- Implemented the argument `counts` in the `evaluation()` function that quantifies how many times each observation should be evaluated due to being selected multiple times in the selection stage.

# jfa 0.2.0

- Implemented prior construction methods `none`, `median`, `hypotheses`, `sample`, and `factor` in the `auditPrior()` function. In addition to the already supported `arm` method, these methods allow the auditor to incorporate more sources of audit information into the prior distribution.  

- Implemented `minPrecision` argument in the `planning()` function that allows auditors to calculate a sample size so that the difference between the posterior upper confidence bound and the most likely error is lower than the set minimum precision. Also implemented in the `evaluation()` function as a requirement to approve the population.

- Return the value `mle` from the `evaluation()` function, which quantifies the most likely error. Also return the value of the `precision` from this function.

- Implemented `increase` argument in the `planning()` function that allows the user to increase the sample size with a set amount each step of the iterations.

- Implemented more efficient versions of the monetary unit sampling algorithms.

- Changed the x-axis labels in the default plot to theta instead of misstatement.

# jfa 0.1.0

- First version of the `jfa` package. The package provides four functions: `auditPrior()`, `planning()`, `sampling()`, and `evaluation()`.
