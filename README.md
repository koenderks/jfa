# jfa: Bayesian and Classical Audit Sampling

<img src="man/figures/logo/jfaLogo.png" width="166" height="192" alt="logo" align="right" margin-left="10"/>

`jfa` is a multi-functional R package for statistical audit sampling.
The package provides the user with four generic functions for planning,
performing, and evaluating an audit sample and its results.
Specifically, it contains functions for calculating sample sizes,
selecting the transactions according to standard auditing techniques,
and calculating various upper limits for the misstatement from the
sample or from summary statistics. The package also allows the user to
create a Bayesian prior probability distribution for use in these
functions.

## Functions

Below is a list of the available functions in the current version of
`jfa`, sorted by their occurrence in the standard audit sampling
workflow.

**Create a prior distribution with the `auditPrior()` function:**

The `auditPrior()` function creates a prior distribution according to
one of several methods, including the audit risk model and assessments
of the inherent and control risk. The returned object is of class
`jfaPrior` and can be used with associated `print()` and `plot()`
methods. `jfaPrior` results can also be used as input argument for the
`prior` argument in other functions.

`auditPrior(confidence = 0.95, likelihood = "binomial", method = "none",
expectedError = 0, N = NULL, materiality = NULL, ir = 1, cr = 1, pHmin =
NULL, pHplus = NULL, factor = 1, sampleN = 0, sampleK = 0)`

Supported features:

| `likelihood`         | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `binomial` (default) | The binomial likelihood and beta prior distribution                |
| `poisson`            | The Poisson likelihood and gamma prior distribution                |
| `hypergeometric`     | The hypergeometric likelihood and beta-binomial prior distribution |

| `method`         | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none` (default) | No prior information incorporated                                                    |
| `arm`            | Risk assessments from the Audit Risk Model using `ir` and `cr`                       |
| `median`         | Equal prior probabilities for (in)tolerable misstatement                             |
| `hypotheses`     | Custom prior probabilities for (in)tolerable misstatement using `pHmin` and `pHplus` |
| `sample`         | Earlier sample using `sampleN` and `sampleK`                                         |
| `factor`         | Weighted earlier sample using `factor`, `sampleN` and `sampleK`                      |

**Plan the sample with the `planning()` function:**

The `planning()` function calculates the required sample size for a
statistical audit sample, based on the poisson, binomial, or
hypergeometric likelihood. A prior can be specified to combine with the
specified likelihood in order to perform Bayesian planning. The returned
`jfaPlanning` object has a `print()` and a `plot()` method.

`planning(confidence = 0.95, expectedError = 0, likelihood = "poisson",
N = NULL, materiality = NULL, minPrecision = NULL, prior = FALSE, kPrior
= 0, nPrior = 0, increase = 1, maxSize = 5000)`

Supported features:

| `likelihood`         | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `binomial` (default) | The binomial likelihood and (optionally) the beta prior distribution                |

| `hypergeometric`     | The hypergeometric likelihood and (optionally) the beta-binomial prior distribution |

**Select transactions with the `selection()` function:**

The `selection()` function takes a data frame and performs sampling
according to one of three algorithms: random sampling, cell sampling, or
fixed interval sampling in combination with either record sampling or
monetary unit sampling. The returned `jfaSelection` object has a
`print()` and a `plot()` method. The `sampleSize` argument can also be
an object of class `jfaPlanning`.

`selection(population, sampleSize, units = "records", algorithm =
"random", bookValues = NULL, intervalStartingPoint = 1, ordered = TRUE,
ascending = TRUE, withReplacement = FALSE, seed = 1)`

Supported features:

| `units`             | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `records` (default) | Record sampling; sampling units are transactions          |

| `interval`         | Systematic sampling / Fixed interval sampling |

**Evaluate the sample with the `evaluation()` function:**

The `evaluation()` function takes a sample data frame or summary
statistics about an evaluated audit sample and calculates a confidence
bound according to a specified method. The returned `jfaEvalution`
object has a `print()` and `plot()` method.

`evaluation(confidence = 0.95, method = "binomial", N = NULL, sample =
NULL, bookValues = NULL, auditValues = NULL, counts = NULL, nSumstats =
NULL, kSumstats = NULL, materiality = NULL, minPrecision = NULL, prior =
FALSE, nPrior = 0, kPrior = 0, rohrbachDelta = 2.7, momentPoptype =
"accounts", populationBookValue = NULL, csA = 1, csB = 3, csMu = 0.5)`
