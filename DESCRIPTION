Description: Implements the audit sampling workflow as discussed in Derks et al. (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/9f6ub>. The package makes it easy for an auditor to plan a statistical sample, select the sample from the population, and evaluate the misstatement in the sample using various methods compliant with the International Standards on Auditing. Furthermore, the package implements Bayesian equivalents of these methods whose statistical underpinnings are described in Derks et al. (2021) <doi:10.1111/ijau.12240> and Derks et al. (2021) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/kzqp5>.
