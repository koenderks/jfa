## Introduction

Welcome to the 'Get started' vignette of the **jfa** package. **jfa** is an R
package that provides Bayesian and classical statistical methods for audit
sampling and data auditing. First, the package provides functions for planning,
performing, evaluating, and reporting an audit sample compliant with
international standards on auditing. Second, the package includes functions for
auditing data, such as testing the distribution of first digits of a data set
against Benford's law.

This vignette provides a simple explanation of the functionality in the package.
For a more detailed explanation of the functions in the package, see the other
vignettes at the [package website](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/).

## Audit sampling

**jfa** provides a user-friendly interface for statistical audit sampling. The
standard audit sampling workflow is divided into four distinct parts: planning a
sample, selecting the sample from the population, executing the audit and
evaluating the misstatement by extrapolating the errors in the sample to the
population.

See the package vignette[Audit sampling: Get started](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/articles/audit-sampling.html)
for more details about **jfa**'s audit sampling functionality.

### Functions and intended usage

To illustrate **jfa**'s' statistical audit sampling functionality, consider the
`BuildIt` data set that comes with the package. This data consists of 3500 items
from a financial statement line item, each of which has a booked value and
(for illustrative purposes) a true (audit) value.

```{r}
# Load the BuildIt population
data("BuildIt")
head(BuildIt)
```

The first step in the audit sampling workflow is to calculate a minimum required
sample size given the purpose of the sample. You can use the sample to 1) obtain
evidence for or against the hypothesis that the misstatement in the population is
lower than the performance materiality and / or 2) estimate the misstatement in
the population. The `planning()` function can be used to calculate this minimum
required sample size.

```{r}
# Stage 1: Planning
stage1 <- planning(
  materiality = 0.03, expected = 0.01,
  likelihood = "poisson", conf.level = 0.95
)
summary(stage1)
```

The `selection()` function can be used to select the required samples from the
population.

```{r}
# Stage 2: Selection
stage2 <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = stage1,
  units = "values", values = "bookValue",
  method = "interval", start = 1
)
summary(stage2)
# Stage 3: Execution
sample <- stage2[["sample"]]
```

The `evaluation()` function can be used to evaluate the misstatement in the
sample.

```{r}
# Stage 4: Evaluation
stage4 <- evaluation(
  materiality = 0.03, method = "stringer",
  conf.level = 0.95, data = sample,
  values = "bookValue", values.audit = "auditValue"
)
summary(stage4)
```

## Data auditing

The `digit_test()` function can be used to test the distribution of leading or
last digits in a variable against a pre-specified distribution (e.g., Benford's
law).

See the package vignette [Data auditing: Get started](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/articles/data-auditing.html)
for more details about **jfa**'s data auditing functionality.

### Functions and intended usage

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Digit distribution test
x <- digit_test(sinoForest$value, check = "first", reference = "benford")
print(x)
plot(x)
```

The `repeated_test()` function can be used to test the numbers in a variable for
repeated values.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Repeated values test
x <- repeated_test(sanitizer$value, check = "lasttwo", samples = 5000)
print(x)
plot(x)
```
